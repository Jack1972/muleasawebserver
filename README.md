# muleasawebserver
Mule As A Webserver is a project i did while i was writing a blog post on the subject. 

The project shows how you can use Mule as a webserver to present a web frontend. The
project contains all the files you need, mule flows, HTML, CSS , Javascript. 
files just start mule and in a browser type localhost:8081. 

So if you already have a mule running you don't need a seperate webserver to present a 
web frontend just use mule.
